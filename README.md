Classification Machine learninng for a Bank Credit Card offer

This project is a part of the IRON HACK at Berlin Data Camo. Other Bootcamp projects can be found at the main GitHub repo.
-- Project Status: [Completed]
Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is Build a model that will provide insight into why some bank customers accept credit card offers. There are also other potential areas of opportunities that the bank wants to understand from the data.

Project Description

The project provides data about details from the customer either they accepted the credit card offer or not. The purpose would be to make a machine learning model for the bank to have a better understanding the market. During the project, I tried different method to deal the categorical and numerical data, spilted the data and learned them with Logistical Regression, KNN Classification. Also did data visulation in Tableau and data analysis with MySQL.
